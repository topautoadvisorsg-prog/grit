OFFICIAL UPDATE — FIGHTER PROFILE STANDARD (UFC 324)
1️⃣ This Sheet IS the Fighter Profile Canon

This CSV represents one complete fighter profile

Treat it as if it were directly imported

Any backend mismatch must be surfaced now

Fight history is NOT part of this import
→ Bout / fight history will be uploaded separately and linked by fighter ID

2️⃣ KEEP ALL FIELDS — INCLUDING “GRAY AREA” STATS

We are NOT removing the following fields:

strikeDefense

submissionAvg

Decision:

These fields must exist in the backend even if data is missing, incomplete, or zero.

Rules:

N/A = data not available

0 = real numeric value

No assumptions

No derived or fabricated values

Empty fields are acceptable. Missing backend fields are not.

3️⃣ FINAL REQUIRED BACKEND FIELD LIST

The backend must support exactly these columns (names are authoritative):

ranking
firstName
lastName
strikesLandedPerMin
strikeAccuracy
strikesAbsorbedPerMin
strikeDefense
takedownAccuracy
takedownDefense
submissionAvg
dateOfBirth
height
reach
legReach
stance
gym
team
nationality
nickname
wins
losses
draws
noContests
koWins
submissionWins
decisionWins
gender
organization
weightClass


No silent remapping

No inferred fields

No auto-calculations

Parse-only where explicitly defined (e.g., height strings → inches if needed)

4️⃣ DATA CONSTRAINTS (IMPORTANT)

organization → always "UFC" (explicit, not implied)

gender → explicit (Male / Female)

weightClass → must be stored exactly as provided

Rankings may be numeric or N/A

Height / reach / leg reach remain string-first, parsed secondarily if needed

5️⃣ ERROR HANDLING RULE

If ANY of the following occur, the dev must stop and report:

Backend missing a field listed above

Field type incompatibility

Unexpected null rejection

Import transform required beyond rename / parse

This is the only acceptable time to flag mismatches.

6️⃣ RESULTING OUTCOME

Once implemented:

This becomes the universal fighter profile schema

All future imports must conform to this standard

Fight history, rankings over time, analytics, and UI layers build on top of this — not inside it
