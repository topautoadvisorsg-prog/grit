Hey — quick alignment as you take over **finishing this app**.

### Where We’re At

* You’re now the **primary developer completing the product**
* Please **read the README first** — it reflects the current architecture and flow
* The **main UI layout is already set**

  * Keep everything **gamified**
  * Simple, clean, entertaining
  * This is a **multi-tenant SaaS product**, so avoid any single-tenant assumptions

### Current Focus (High Priority)

1. **Real Fighter Data (In Progress)**

   * We are moving away from mock fighter profiles
   * We will start by importing **real fighters tied to a real event**
   * First test event: **UFC 324 (upcoming card)**
   * Fighters from that full card will be imported and attached to the event

2. **Import Flow (Critical)**

   * I’ll provide you:

     * The fighter fields I currently have
     * Their exact column names (Excel / CSV)
   * Your task:

     * Verify field name alignment with the backend
     * Tell me:

       * What matches
       * What needs renaming
       * What’s missing
   * Goal:
     👉 I should be able to **copy-paste or import an Excel sheet cleanly** without manual fixes

3. **Event ↔ Fighter Logic**

   * Fighters will be attached **through event creation**
   * This UFC 324 card will be our **validation dataset**
   * Once this works, we’ll scale to more events and historical data

### UI / UX Expectations

* No redesigns unless something is broken
* Keep interactions **fun, fast, and obvious**
* Avoid dead-end states or confusing messages
* Everything should feel like a product, not a dashboard

### Important Notes

* **Do NOT touch user logic yet**

  * We are keeping mock users for now
  * User cleanup will happen later after validation
* If you find gaps, edge cases, or unclear logic:

  * Flag them
  * Don’t silently hack around them

### Documentation & Code Quality

* If anything you touch is **not reflected in the README**:

  * Add a short note or section
* Clean up:

  * Dead code
  * Unused imports
  * Incorrect assumptions
* Call out anything that feels brittle or rushed

---

**Immediate next step:**
Review import logic + Event Card flow, then be ready to validate UFC 324 fighter imports once I send the field list.

We’re close — this phase is about **correctness, clarity, and real data**.
