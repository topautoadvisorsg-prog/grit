Tell him to execute this exactly.

Phase 1 — Architecture Isolation Verification (URGENT)
Backend Separation

Confirm:

Admin server logic is isolated from user server logic.

No business rule is shared directly through imports.

Run project-wide search:

import .*admin
import .*user
../admin
../user

If found → refactor.

Repository Export Safety Checklist

Before exporting folder to new repo:

Verify:

✅ No relative path coupling across domains
✅ Database access goes through storage abstraction layer
✅ Shared types are placed in /shared-core only
✅ Environment variables are loaded per server runtime
✅ CI build script does not reference parent directory

If any fail → DO NOT EXPORT.

Phase 2 — Dashboard Widget Activation

Activate:

ActivityWidget

BadgeWidget

CountdownWidget

StatsWidget

Steps:

Add widgets into dashboard render tree.

Bind to API data streams if available.

Remove dead placeholder JSX.

Verify hydration consistency.

Phase 3 — Fight History Architecture Fix (Highest Priority)

Remove client-side storage persistence.

Implement:

User Action → User API Server → Database → Client Render

Never:

Client LocalStorage ←→ UI State Truth Source
Phase 4 — Codebase Cleanup (Quality Improvement)
Remove Debug Logging

Delete or centralize:

138 console.log / console.error statements.

Use one logging utility.

Split Large Components

Split these files:

LandingPage.tsx

Settings.tsx

ImportPage.tsx

Target size:

< 300 lines per UI component.

Split Domain Types

Refactor:

shared/types/fighter.ts

Into domain schemas:

FighterProfile

FightRecord

EventSchema

PerformanceMetrics

Phase 5 — Security Hardening

Add:

Input validation middleware (Zod-style runtime guard)

Rate limiting for public endpoints

Role enforcement on admin APIs

Especially protect:

Odds editor

User role manager

Import pipeline

Phase 6 — Scalability Target

System must sustain:

≥ 100,000 weekly users

Low latency read endpoints

Pagination everywhere

Audit endpoints that return lists.
