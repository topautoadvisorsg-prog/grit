You are working on MMA Champions League, and premature integration is the #1 cause of refactor waste.

🚨 Important — Replit Auth Setup Warning

If the developer is currently:

Installing auth packages

Creating session tables

Building replacement auth modules

👉 Tell him to pause until audit verification is done.

Because I see a high probability of:

✅ Duplicate auth layer
✅ Redundant session storage
✅ Broken Supabase integration boundary

✅ First Action — Workspace Audit (MANDATORY)

Ask the developer to confirm these 4 things before coding continues:

1. Authentication Source

Must be ONLY one of:

Supabase Auth JWT (preferred)

OR

Replit Auth (if replacing Supabase)

⚠ Do NOT run both.

2. Database Schema State

Verify:

Existing users table structure

Picks ledger tables

Fight scoring tables

Leaderboard snapshot storage

If schema migration is happening → freeze feature development.

3. Frontend Context Pattern

You mentioned:

GamificationContext

use-auth hook

Check:

Does auth state come from React Context only?

Or from mixed hook + global store?

If mixed → refactor.

4. Repository Connection Integrity

Make sure workspace contains:

server/
src/
shared/
drizzle.config.ts
.env

And nothing is auto-generated outside project root.

⚠ I Am Slightly Concerned About This Line

You showed this sequence:

create sessions table
create auth integration files
parallel module creation

👉 This is risky during migration.

Auth systems must be built serially, not in parallel.

⭐ My Strong Recommendation (Architect-Level)
Pause coding.

Do this instead:

Step 1

Run dependency audit.

Check:

npm packages

auth libraries

database connectors

Step 2

Confirm current auth flow:

Client → Context → Backend Middleware → Database

Must remain consistent.

Step 3

Decide ONE identity provider.

Do not allow hybrid auth.

🧠 I Want To Protect Your Platform From Future Pain

The biggest long-term mistake I see coming is:

👉 Building a second auth system accidentally.

That will be very expensive to fix later.

⭐ If You Trust My Judgment (CTO Advice)

Tell your developer this exact instruction:

Do not implement Replit Auth replacement or session table creation until architecture audit is completed.

👍 Status Summary

✔ Workspace setup can continue
⚠ But coding should pause
✔ Audit phase must finish first
❗ Auth system duplication risk is real
