OFFICIAL DECISION — CONFIRMED BY FACTS

We acknowledge and confirm the following as CURRENT REALITY (no debate):

imageUrl = required face image (URL only today)

bodyImageUrl = optional full-body image (URL only today)

No upload system exists

No storage exists

No validation exists

No admin edit UI exists

CSV import currently overwrites URLs, which is acceptable behavior

This is fine. We are moving forward intentionally, not patching randomly.

BUSINESS DECISION (LOCK THIS IN)

We are KEEPING BOTH IMAGE FIELDS:

imageUrl (FACE)

bodyImageUrl (BODY)

Even if some fighters are missing images, fields stay.
Empty / null is acceptable.

This fighter profile schema is now the STANDARD BASE PROFILE.
Fight history remains separate and will be imported independently.

IMAGE RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE — FINAL)
Face Image (imageUrl)

Face only

NO shoulders

Portrait-oriented

1 image max

New upload replaces old image

Body Image (bodyImageUrl)

Full body / stance

1 image max

New upload replaces old image

No galleries. No extras. No third image. Ever.

WHAT MUST BE BUILT (PHASED, NO SHORTCUTS)
PHASE 1 — Backend Foundations

Developer must implement:

Image upload endpoint

Accepts file upload (not URL)

Supports jpg, png, webp

Max file size defined (recommend 2–5 MB)

Storage

Choose ONE and document it:

Replit Object Storage or

S3-compatible bucket

Return stored URL → saved into:

imageUrl OR bodyImageUrl

Replacement logic

Uploading a new image overwrites existing URL

No duplicates possible (schema already enforces this)

PHASE 2 — Admin UI (CRITICAL)

Add an Admin → Fighter Manager (NOT CSV):

Fighter Selection

Filters:

Organization

Weight Class

Search:

Typeahead by name (G → Gaethje, etc.)

Fighter Edit Screen

Once fighter is selected:

Editable fields (only existing schema fields)

Two upload slots only:

Face Image

Body Image

If an image exists:

Show preview

Uploading replaces it

No CSV required for edits.

PHASE 3 — Validation & UX Guardrails

Minimum enforcement:

Backend:

File type validation

File size limit

Frontend:

Clear labels: FACE (no shoulders) / BODY

Crop / ratio guidance (even text warning is fine for v1)

Aspect ratio hard-enforcement can come later if needed.

IMPORTANT: WHAT NOT TO DO

❌ Do NOT rename fields again

❌ Do NOT add new image fields

❌ Do NOT allow more than 2 images

❌ Do NOT mix fight history with profile data

❌ Do NOT force CSV for updates
