We are now in runtime defect correction phase.

Do not focus on architecture restructuring.

We must fix two functional problems:

---

## 1. Get Started Button — Navigation / Authentication Failure

The “Get Started” action is currently not triggering proper workflow.

Please verify and fix:

* Frontend event handler binding for the button
* API call execution when the button is clicked
* Response handling from authentication endpoint
* Route navigation after successful authentication

Check browser console errors.

Check Network tab for failed requests.

Expected behavior:

Click → Authentication request → Response → Redirect → Load user/admin UI.

If any step is broken, repair the wiring without rewriting authentication architecture.

---

## 2. Language Selector — Translation Context Not Applied

The globe icon dropdown exists, but translation is not actually affecting page content.

Please verify:

* i18n context provider is mounted at application root level
* Language state is stored and broadcast to components
* Translation files are loaded before page rendering
* Components are using translation hooks or context consumers

Fix the wiring so language selection immediately updates visible text.

Do not just update UI elements.

The system must truly switch locale rendering.

## 3. Backend Connection Verification

Confirm that:

* Authentication API endpoint is reachable
* Request is actually being sent when Get Started is clicked
* Role-based response is returned

---

## 4. Development Constraint

Do NOT introduce new server architecture.

Do NOT split user/admin servers.

Do NOT remove working logic.

Only repair broken flows.

---

## 5. Developer Request

Please report:

* What exact error appears in browser console when clicking Get Started
* Whether authentication request is being sent
* Whether language selector state is updating internally

Fix the wiring first.

After these two defects are resolved, we can proceed to functional testing.

Return status after patching.
