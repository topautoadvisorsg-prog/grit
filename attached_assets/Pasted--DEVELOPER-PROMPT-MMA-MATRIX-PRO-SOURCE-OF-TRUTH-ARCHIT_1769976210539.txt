🔥 DEVELOPER PROMPT — MMA MATRIX PRO (SOURCE OF TRUTH ARCHITECTURE)
1) Core Rule (DO NOT BREAK THIS)

The Fighter Profile is the ONLY source of truth.

No module is allowed to define fighter data independently.

All modules must read from Fighter Profiles:

Events

Fight Cards

Rankings

Metrics

Picks

Export

Admin Views

If fighter data changes → every module must update automatically.

If a module does not reflect fighter data → it is a bug.

2) Scope Clarification (IMPORTANT)

This is NOT a live-tracking app.

Data is manually updated by admin using UFC official stats.

Workflow:

Before fight → event created manually

During fight → nothing automated

After fight → admin updates results manually

Fighter stats updated manually from UFC data

Source of data = UFC stats only.

No AI.
No external APIs (for now).

3) Fighter Profile — REQUIRED DATA MODEL

You must ensure ALL these fields exist in the Fighter Profile model and UI.

Identity
id (uuid)
firstName
lastName
nickname
fullName (computed)
dateOfBirth
age (computed)
nationality
gender

Organization / Division
organization (default: UFC)

isVerified (boolean) ✅ REQUIRED


⚠️ Verification Logic:

Only two states: VERIFIED / NOT VERIFIED

Admin manually decides verification

No AI, no sources, no automation

4) Fighter Images — REQUIRED RULE

Each fighter can have ONLY 2 images max.

Rule:

When a new image is uploaded:

If there are already 2 images → delete the oldest one automatically.

No image history.

No unlimited storage.

You must implement this logic in Fighter Manager.

5) Admin Panel — REQUIRED FEATURES
Fighter Manager MUST allow:

Edit all fighter fields

Toggle isVerified

Upload fighter images (with 2-image rule)

Save changes persistently

Missing Issue to Fix:

Currently:

Fighters appear in admin editor

But NOT on the public site

This means:

👉 Data is not synced between environments or storage layers.

You must fix the data persistence architecture.

6) Data Persistence Rule

Current problem:

localStorage works only per environment/browser

Dev site ≠ Published site

Required solution:

Either:

Option A (temporary but consistent)

Unify storage layer so:

Admin edits → reflected in public UI

Option B (real solution)

Implement real database:

Tables already defined:

fighters
fight_history
events
event_fights
users
user_picks
fight_results
news_articles


All UI must read from the same database.

7) Events System — Required Behavior

Events must NOT use mock data.

Required:

Create Event (admin)

Add fights to event

Link fighters by fighter_id

Edit event

Delete event

Fight Card must pull fighters from Fighter Profiles.

8) Fight History — Required Rules

Fighters must exist before fight history can be imported

Fight records are immutable after creation

Linked by:

fighter_id (preferred)

fallback: fullName match

9) Critical Bugs to Fix (PRIORITY)
HIGH PRIORITY

isVerified field missing in Fighter Profile UI

Fighters not showing on public site

Image upload logic missing

Mock event fallback still active

Event editing/deletion missing

If these are not fixed → architecture is broken.

10) Developer Objective

Your job is NOT to add random features.

Your job is to make sure:

✅ Fighter Profile is complete
✅ All modules read from Fighter Profile
✅ Admin changes reflect everywhere
✅ Data persistence is consistent
✅ No mock data in production logic

If Fighter Profile is stable → we move to Events, Rankings, Analytics.

If Fighter Profile is not stable → everything else is useless.
