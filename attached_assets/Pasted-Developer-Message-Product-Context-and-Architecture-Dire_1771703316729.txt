Developer Message — Product Context and Architecture Direction

Project Vision

We are building **MMA Champions League**, which started as a small personal project and is evolving into a large-scale community and analytics ecosystem.

The platform is not just a picks or fantasy system. It is designed to become a competitive sports intelligence network that combines:

• Prediction engagement
• Fighter performance analysis
• Community interaction
• Gamification reputation tracking
• AI-assisted matchup insight generation

The long-term goal is to transform combat sports knowledge into measurable competitive intelligence.

Current Engineering Strategy

We are now entering the architectural stabilization phase.

The system must be separated into logical domains to support future scaling and multi-developer collaboration.

Domain Isolation Philosophy

1. User Platform Domain
   This is the public-facing product.

It includes:

* Chat systems
* Picks and predictions
* Rankings and leaderboard views
* News and community interaction
* Gamification feedback and reputation signals
* AI analysis presentation layers

The user domain should focus on runtime experience, not control logic.

2. Admin Control Domain
   This is the operator governance layer.

It should only handle:

* Event lifecycle management
* Fighter database maintenance
* Prediction seed input
* Moderation oversight
* Content publishing control

Admin logic must be isolated from public runtime logic.

3. Intelligence Engine Domain (Future Core Value)

This subsystem will be responsible for:

* AI prediction computation
* Matchup analysis generation
* Virality engagement modeling
* Asynchronous insight processing

Important Rule

We follow an additive development philosophy.

✔ Do not delete working code unless replacement code is tested.
✔ Move code safely during migration.
✔ Maintain build stability.
✔ Avoid architecture rewriting while features are still evolving.

Folder Structure Direction

Frontend code should be organized into:

/admin
/user
/engine
/shared

Shared folder should contain:

* UI primitives
* Auth hooks
* Type models
* Infrastructure utilities

Business logic should not be mixed across domains.

Repository Workflow Goal

The objective is to eventually allow:

• Multiple developers to work independently
• Clear domain boundaries
• Safe scaling of the platform

Communication Expectation

If you encounter ambiguity in project goals, ask questions before implementing code.

Product Understanding Check

Please confirm that you understand:

1. The platform is becoming a combat sports intelligence ecosystem.
2. Domain separation is intended to improve maintainability and scalability.
3. No working functionality should be removed during migration.
4. Backend security enforcement is mandatory even if frontend guards exist.

If anything in the system design conflicts with your implementation plan, please discuss it first.

Engineering Partnership Note

We are building a long-term quality product for many users.

The priority is:

Stability → Scalability → Feature Growth → Innovation

Thank you for contributing to the platform development.
