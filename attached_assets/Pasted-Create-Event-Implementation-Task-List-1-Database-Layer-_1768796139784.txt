Create Event — Implementation Task List
1. Database Layer

Add events table:

Columns: id, name, date, venue, city, state, country, organization, description

Add event_fights table:

Columns: id, event_id, fighter1_id, fighter2_id, card_placement (enum), is_title_fight (boolean), rounds (integer)

Foreign keys: event_id → events.id, fighter1_id & fighter2_id → fighters.id

Ensure relationships and constraints to prevent duplicate fights per event

2. API Layer

POST /api/events

Accept event metadata + array of fights

Validate fighters exist, enforce card placement rules

Save in a single transaction (event + fights)

GET /api/events (optional)

Return list of events with minimal metadata

GET /api/events/:id

Return single event + all associated fights for edit/view

3. Frontend

Event Details Section:

Fields: Name, Date, Venue, City, State, Country, Organization, Description

Fight Builder Section:

Add/edit/remove fights before final save

Searchable fighter dropdown with filters: organization & weight class

Card placement selector: Main Event, Co-Main, Main Card, Prelim

Title fight toggle

Rounds selector (auto-defaults to 5 for main/title fights)

Maintain local state until submit

Submit event → POST API endpoint

4. UI/UX

Match existing dark theme with cyan/teal accents

Toast notifications on save success/failure

Loading states during fighter fetch & event creation

Scroll to latest fight after adding to list

5. Testing / Verification

Verify event + fights saved correctly in database

Ensure fighter selection works and prevents duplicates

Verify card placement assignment is correct

Smoke test with UFC 324 sample data

6. Proposed Implementation Steps

Add event + event_fights tables to database

Implement API endpoints (POST + GET)

Build frontend form for event creation

Build fight card builder UI with filters & toggles

Connect frontend to API, maintain local state

Add notifications, loading states, and UX polish

Test with UFC 324 sample event

Verify DB entries, relationships, and card placement correctness
