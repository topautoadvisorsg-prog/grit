Global System Audit & Completion Readiness Prompt

You are working as an expert SaaS architect collaborator.

Your task is to audit the entire codebase and system implementation.

Do not focus on a single feature.

Review everything.

1. Current Project Objective

The goal of this project is to build a scalable combat sports intelligence platform.

The system must support:

Prediction engagement

Ranking analytics

Gamified competition layers

Fighter data intelligence

Multi-context communication

Administrative management tools

Landing experience presentation

2. Full Codebase Audit Requirement

Please review the entire repository and evaluate:

Architecture Layer

Folder structure cleanliness

Module isolation

Shared logic consolidation

Dependency coupling risks

Report:

Technical debt areas

Refactoring recommendations

Missing core components

Runtime Stability

Verify that the application can:

Compile successfully

Run locally

Load landing page

Authenticate users

Render main UI modules

If any runtime instability exists, identify it.

Feature Completion Assessment

Evaluate whether the system is actually ready for functional testing.

Check completeness of:

User-facing interface

Administrative control systems

Data ingestion pipelines

Routing logic

State management

Asset loading

Language localization integration

Prediction and analytics components

3. Integration Verification

Confirm that the following subsystems are properly connected:

Frontend → Backend API layer

Authentication → Role authorization

Shared utilities → Feature modules

Database models → Application logic

If anything is disconnected, report it.

4. Performance & Scalability Review

Evaluate risks related to:

Memory usage

Request handling

Asset delivery (including hero frame sequence system)

Real-time interaction components

Message or competition event updates

Suggest optimizations.

5. Security Review

Check for:

Secret leakage risk (especially environment variables)

Unauthorized route exposure

Authentication bypass possibilities

Data protection gaps

6. Completion Status Judgment

Please answer honestly:

Is the system actually ready for testing?

What is missing before functional validation can begin?

What parts are still in development?

What is the biggest architectural risk right now?

7. Developer Collaboration Style

Work as a partner architect.

Do not assume missing pieces.

If something is unclear, ask.

If something is broken, report it.

If something can be improved, suggest it.

Final Request
