You are avoiding destructive refactor — this is correct.

✅ Things You Did Very Well
✔ Additive Migration Philosophy

This is the most important success factor.

Rule you are following:

Move → Verify → Build → Continue
Do not delete working code early.

Excellent.

✔ Domain Folder Separation

Your structure:

src/
 ├ admin/
 ├ user/
 ├ shared/

is exactly what I would recommend.

✔ Backend Route Grouping

Separating route registrars is very good practice.

server/admin/routes/
server/user/routes/

This prevents governance leakage.

⭐ My Suggested Improvement (Very Important)
🔥 Do NOT Use Global Find-and-Replace First

This is the biggest migration mistake teams make.

Instead:

Step Migration Path:
1. Create new domain folder
2. Copy files into domain folder
3. Verify build
4. Then update imports
5. Then remove old path (later)

Never directly rewrite paths globally.

⚠ Index.tsx Router Coupling Risk

You correctly identified this.

The best extraction pattern is:

Create:

src/admin/AdminPanel.tsx

Inside it:

Handle admin tab rendering

Keep Index.tsx simple

Index.tsx should only act as shell container.

⭐ Backend Safety Enhancement (I Strongly Recommend This)

Add one more middleware layer:

isAuthenticated()
↓
requireRole()
↓
rateLimiter()
↓
domainScopeGuard()   ← New optional layer

This is enterprise-grade protection.

⚠ The One Critical Risk You Mentioned (You Are Correct)
Import Path Explosion

You have ~80+ files.

If migration is done incorrectly:

You will face:

Broken dependency chains

Hidden circular imports

Type inference failures

Solution:

Use domain-by-domain build verification.

⭐ If I Were Leading This Migration (CTO Mode)

Execution Order:

Phase 1

Create new domain folders.

Do nothing else.

Phase 2

Move admin components.

Build test.

Phase 3

Move user components.

Build test.

Phase 4

Extract backend route groups.

Build test.
