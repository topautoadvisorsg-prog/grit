Here’s how we can structure this for the developer conversation and clarify the logic before moving forward with importing/updating fight histories:

1️⃣ Purpose / Goal

Ensure all fighter fight history fields are captured correctly.

Enable both uploading new fight history and updating existing fight info after events.

Maintain consistency between fighter profile stats and event/fight ledger stats.

2️⃣ Fight History Fields Required

For each fight, these fields must exist and be updateable:

Basic Fight Metadata

event_name

event_date

fight_card_position (Main Event / Co-Main / Undercard)

fight_type (e.g., Interim Lightweight Title Bout)

method (Decision, KO, TKO, Submission, etc.)

rounds_total

rounds_completed

round_time_format (5-5-5-5-5, etc.)

referee

judges_scores

Fighter-Specific Fight Stats (for each fighter)

fighter_id / name

result (Win / Loss / Draw / NC)

KD (knockdowns)

sig_str_landed / sig_str_attempted

sig_str_accuracy %

total_str_landed / total_str_attempted

td_landed / td_attempted

td_accuracy %

sub_attempts

reversals

control_time

significant_strikes_by_target: head / body / leg

significant_strikes_by_position: distance / clinch / ground

per_round_stats (optional but preferred for detailed breakdown)

3️⃣ Integration Questions for the Developer

How does uploaded fight history data link to an existing fighter profile?

When a fight is uploaded, does it update the fighter’s cumulative stats automatically? Or is it manual?

Can the fight history be edited after upload (for corrections)?

How does this connect to the Fight Management / Event Ledger section? Does updating the fight there also update fighter profile stats?

Is there any hard-coded field we should be aware of, or can everything be updated via the admin panel?

How are per-round stats handled? Do they need to be stored separately or aggregated into the total fight stats?

4️⃣ Key Notes / Requirements

Only admin should have access to update these stats.

Any update to a fighter’s fight stats should reflect both in the fighter profile averages and in the event ledger.

Historical uploads vs. live event updates must follow the same schema, so no data conflicts occur.

All fields in the fight history must be mapped 1:1 with the database, no missing or optional fields for critical stats.
