We’re moving on to the **fight history** portion now. Before we touch scale, we need clarity and a controlled test.

### 1. Current Fight History Implementation — FACT CHECK

Please confirm, **as it exists today** (no proposals yet):

* How is fight history stored?

  * Separate table/collection per fight?
  * Embedded inside fighter profile?
* How is fight history currently added or updated?

  * CSV / Excel import?
  * Manual entry?
  * Code-only / seed data?
* How is a fight linked to a fighter?

  * Fighter ID?
  * Name matching?
  * Event ID?
* Can fight history be:

  * Updated for a **single fighter**?
  * Uploaded in **bulk** (CSV/Excel)?
* What happens on re-import?

  * Overwrite?
  * Append?
  * Duplicate protection?

We need to understand the **exact current behavior**, not intended behavior.

### 2. Required Fight History Flows (What We Expect to Support)

Ultimately, fight history must support **both** of these paths:

**A. Individual Fighter Update**

* Select fighter
* Add / edit a single fight record
* No CSV required

**B. Bulk Import**

* Upload Excel / CSV
* Multiple fights
* Multiple fighters
* Deterministic linking (no guessing)

If one of these does not exist yet, call it out clearly.

### 3. Smoke Test — REAL DATA (NEXT STEP)

After confirming the above, we will do a **small, real-data smoke test**:

* We will provide:

  * **2 real fighters**
  * **Their real fight history**
* You will:

  * Import or attach that data using the current system
  * Verify:

    * Correct fighter association
    * No duplication
    * Proper ordering (most recent, etc.)
    * No schema or logic breaks

This test is strictly to validate **end-to-end correctness**, not performance or scale.

---

### 4. Important Boundaries

* Fight history is **separate** from fighter profile base data
* No assumptions about naming, ordering, or overwrites
* If anything is missing or unclear in the schema or flow:

  * This is the time to flag it

Once we pass the 2-fighter smoke test, we’ll decide how to scale imports safely.

Reply with:

1. Current fight history behavior (facts only)
2. Gaps vs requirements
3. What path you recommend for the smoke test (individual vs CSV)

Then we proceed.
