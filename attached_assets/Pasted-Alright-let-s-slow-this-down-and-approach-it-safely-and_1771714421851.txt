Alright — let’s slow this down and approach it safely and architecturally.

### 1. Landing Page Language Issue

You mentioned multiple language support is missing on the landing page.

Please check:

* Is the i18n initialization running before the landing page mounts?
* Are translation files loaded asynchronously?
* Is the language selector component wired to state?

If the landing page cannot switch languages, this is likely a bootstrap or context wiring problem rather than a server separation issue.

### 2. Login Flow Blocking Issue

When clicking “Get Started” and nothing happens, we need to determine:

* Is the authentication route triggered?
* Is the frontend navigation handler working?
* Is the backend auth endpoint reachable?

Please verify:

* Console logs in browser developer tools.
* Network tab request behavior when clicking the button.

Do not create new server architecture yet if the login flow is simply miswired.

### 3. Admin Access for Testing

To test admin functionality safely:

You do not need a separate physical server right now.

The recommended approach is:

* Use role-based authentication inside the same backend service.
* Create an admin test account.
* Enable route guards based on user role.

This avoids unnecessary infrastructure complexity.

### 4. User vs Admin Separation Strategy

Based on current project size, I suggest NOT splitting into different servers yet.

Instead:

* Keep one backend server.
* Implement logical separation using:

  * Middleware authentication
  * Role authorization layers
  * Module-based routing

Only consider multi-server architecture later if scale demands it.

### 5. Your Immediate Testing Steps

Please help confirm:

1. Whether login API endpoint is responding.
2. Whether navigation after “Get Started” is being triggered.
3. Whether admin role detection is working.

If login is blocked, fix authentication flow first before continuing structural separation.

### 6. My Question Back to You

Is the login button simply not navigating, or is authentication itself failing?

Please check browser console errors and report what you see.

Once login flow is working, we can safely proceed with admin testing and module validation.

Let’s stabilize runtime behavior first before doing architectural expansion.
