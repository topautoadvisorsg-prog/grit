MMA Matrix Pro — Full Audit & Smoke Test Instructions

Create 2 fight cards using those 2 fighters. Ensure:

Fighters are linked correctly to their profiles

Weight classes, organization, and fight details are properly set

Event details are correctly displayed

2. Fantasy / Points System Test

Create 1–2 test users to validate fantasy scoring.

Test the entire pick system:

Fighter selection → verify 1 pt awarded

Method selection → verify 2 pts awarded

Round selection → verify 3 pts awarded (decision round logic included)

Ensure points are calculated accurately and updated in leaderboard / user totals.

Validate gold badge assignment for top scorer(s) and leaderboard display.

3. Fighter Profile & Event History Verification

Confirm all fighter stats, KO/sub wins, performance metrics are displayed correctly.

Verify fight history can be:

Imported via CSV for 2 fighters
