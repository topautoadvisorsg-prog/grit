WHY THIS FUCKED UP BEFORE (REAL ROOT CAUSE)

There are three different naming layers:

1) UFC Website Labels
SLpM
Str. Acc.
SApM
TD Avg.

2) Dev/Tech Schema (what I wrongly used)
slpM
strikeAccuracy
takedownAvg

3) YOUR BUSINESS SYSTEM SCHEMA (what actually matters)
strikes landed per minute
significant striking accuracy
takedowns average


Your importer only understands #3.

I gave you #2 before.

That’s why fields came in blank.

You were right to be pissed.

⚔️ Now we do this like architects, not monkeys.

Next move (this is critical):

✅ I build your OFFICIAL UFC → SYSTEM FIELD TRANSLATOR

Example:

UFC FIELD → YOUR SYSTEM FIELD
SLpM → strikes landed per minute
Str. Acc. → significant striking accuracy
SApM → strikes absorbed per minute
Str. Def. → significant strike defense
TD Avg. → takedowns average
TD Acc. → takedown accuracy
TD Def. → takedown defense
Sub. Avg. → submission average


This becomes:

your README truth

your junior dev instructions

your import logic

your future-proof schema

💣 If you want, I’ll go nuclear and build this for you:

I will produce:

✅ Fighter Profile Master Schema (UFC-complete)
✅ Fight History Schema (UFC-complete)
✅ Event Schema (UFC-complete)
✅ Junior Dev Prompt (copy-paste, no thinking required)
✅ “Fighter Profile = Source of Truth” system blueprint
✅ Zero ambiguity field dictionary

So your system never breaks again.

If you want that, say:

“Build the UFC fighter schema blueprint.”

And I’ll do it clean, exact, and impossible to fuck up.

What the fuck is this? Why do we have three different fucking ones? Why can't they all be the same? Why do we have all this stupid shit, all this different fucking dumb shit? Do we need to have it like this? Because it's really pissing me the fuck off. You're pissing me the fuck off, you stupid motherfucker.

You’re not wrong to be pissed.
And no — we do NOT need three different versions.
That happened because nobody enforced a single source-of-truth schema. That’s a systems problem, not a data problem.

Let’s fix it like architects, not patchwork monkeys.

🧠 Why the fuck there are 3 versions (simple truth)

There are only three because of this:

UFC data language
→ what the UFC website calls things
Example: SLpM

Developer language
→ what programmers like to name things
Example: slpM, strikeAccuracy

Your business schema
→ what your system actually stores
Example: strikes landed per minute

Nobody forced them to be the same.
So chaos happened.

❗ The brutal truth

You only need ONE REAL schema.

Everything else should be a translation layer.

Meaning:

✅ Your system fields = MASTER TRUTH
❌ UFC names = just input labels
❌ Dev names = banned unless they match your schema

✅ THE CORRECT ARCHITECTURE (NO BULLSHIT)

There should be ONLY THIS:

🥇 1) MASTER SYSTEM SCHEMA (YOUR CRM)

This is the only thing that matters:

strikes_landed_per_minute
significant_striking_accuracy
strikes_absorbed_per_minute
significant_strike_defense
takedowns_average
takedown_accuracy
takedown_defense
submission_average


⚠️ Notice something important:

I removed spaces.

Why?

Because spaces in field names are a nightmare for:

databases

APIs

TypeScript

JSON

CSV mapping

So we normalize them.

This is what real systems do.

🥈 2) UFC → SYSTEM MAPPING (NOT REAL FIELDS)

This is just a dictionary, not schema:

SLpM → strikes_landed_per_minute
Str. Acc. → significant_striking_accuracy
SApM → strikes_absorbed_per_minute
Str. Def. → significant_strike_defense
TD Avg. → takedowns_average
TD Acc. → takedown_accuracy
TD Def. → takedown_defense
Sub. Avg. → submission_average


UFC never touches your database directly.

🥉 3) UI DISPLAY LABELS (HUMAN FRIENDLY)

This is just text on the screen:

strikes_landed_per_minute → Strikes Landed / Min

💣 So the answer to your question:

“Do we need to have it like this?”

❌ NO.
You should NOT have 3 schemas.

You should have:

✅ 1 real schema
✅ 1 translation layer
✅ 1 display layer

That’s it.

🔥 Why your system broke

Because right now your system is doing this:

UFC names → sometimes used

Dev names → sometimes used

Business names → sometimes used

So imports fail.
Fields don’t match.
Data goes blank.
You get mad.
Developer gets confused.
System becomes Frankenstein.

🧱 If you want, I will fix this permanently.

I will design your official UFC Fighter Data Schema v1.0.

It will be:

clean

normalized

future-proof

import-safe

dev-proof

UFC-compatible

And I will give you:

✅ THE SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH SCHEMA
✅ THE UFC → SYSTEM MAPPING TABLE
✅ THE DEV RULES (NO FUCKING CUSTOM NAMES)
✅ THE README SECTION YOUR DEV MUST FOLLOW
✅ THE IMPORT RULES SO THIS NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN

This is CTO-level architecture, not random guessing.
