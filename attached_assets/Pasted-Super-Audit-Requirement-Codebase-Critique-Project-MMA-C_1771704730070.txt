Super Audit Requirement — Codebase Critique

Project: MMA Champions League Platform

Objective

Perform a deep structural audit of the platform codebase.

The purpose of this audit is to ensure the system is:

• Cleanly structured
• Easily maintainable by another developer
• Ready for domain isolation deployment
• Clearly documented through README instructions

Audit Scope

Please review the entire project and provide detailed answers to the following.

1. Code Quality Assessment

Evaluate:

* Naming consistency
* Component complexity
* Duplicate logic
* Unused or dead code
* Circular dependencies
* Over-coupled modules
* Business logic inside UI layers

If any area is considered weak or messy, clearly report it.

---

2. Domain Isolation Readiness

Verify that the codebase can be separated into:

User Domain Server
Admin Domain Server

Answer:

• What files belong to User runtime system
• What files belong to Admin governance system
• What files should remain shared infrastructure

Provide a mapping recommendation.

---

3. Tab Ownership Classification

Review all sidebar tabs and classify them into:

User Platform Tabs:

* Community interaction
* Predictions
* Rankings
* Chat
* News
* Utility tools

Admin Platform Tabs:

* Event lifecycle control
* Fighter management
* Moderation
* Dataset governance
* Publishing management

Explain your reasoning if classification is ambiguous.

---

4. Isolation Documentation Requirement (Very Important)

Create a README section explaining:

• How domain isolation works in this project
• How to set up User Server deployment
• How to set up Admin Server deployment
• How authentication flows across domains
• How shared infrastructure is used

The README must be written so that:

Another developer can understand the architecture in less than one day.

---

5. Risk Identification

Identify:

• Areas where refactor risk is high
• Files that are tightly coupled
• Potential scaling bottlenecks
• Security vulnerabilities in route handling

---

6. Clean Architecture Standards

Ensure codebase follows additive development philosophy:

• Do not remove working features unless replacement is tested
• Prefer file movement over deletion
• Verify build stability after structural changes

---

7. Final Deliverable

Provide:

• Audit summary
• Recommended improvements
• Domain isolation readiness score (0–100)
• List of critical issues if any exist
